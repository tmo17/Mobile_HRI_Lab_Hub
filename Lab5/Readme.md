# Give the robot moves

Now, let's control our robots to make them move intuitively. 

As you have seen, it's pretty easy to control the wheels with Python! However, it's not easy for us as humans to move the robot in ways that feel right while thinking in terms of individual wheel velocity. If you are a gamer, you might be pretty familiar with controlling avatars with joystick controllers or keyboard keys (WASD). In today's lab, let's map joystick controller commands to wheel velocities in Python.

## Prep

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Your Computer
2. Joystick Controller
3. Your set of hoverboard + ODrive
4. (optional) Cardboard to make the proto-chassis for your robot

### Deliverables for this lab are: 

1. Videos of you controlling the wheels with your joystick controller properly.
2. Three ideas on how to use controllers' rumble feature for Wizard of Oz control.
3. (optional) Documentation of the robot proto-chassis
